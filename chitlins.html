    <h3>Descrpition</h3>
    <p>To me,  holidays are all about family. When I was a young girl We had huge holiday potlucks.
         Our menu consist of hams, turkeys, greens, cakes, and a big ol’ pot of Holiday Chitterlings ( or chittlins!).
          Each of my aunts, and my mom, have their own twist when it comes to chitterlings.
         None of the ladies make chitterlings the same. However, all of my aunts make their chittlins SPICY. 
         My mom likes to use Jalapenos, and one of my aunts like to use red pepper flakes. 
         I could never decide on using just one spicy ingredient, so I use both.
    </p>
    <p>I don’t have the patience like the women in my family, because I hate the cleaning process.
         I remember helping my mom clean chitterlings, and since they’re been selling pre-cleaned chitterlings, that’s all I buy.
          I purchase the super cleaned pork chitterlings at my local grocery store.
           However,  even the super clean chitterlings have a odor s I am going to walk you through the soaking process to help you deodorize the chitterlings before cooking them.
